# Notes

## Recording Session
- Recorded: January 10, 2025
- Studio: Home Studio, Room B
- Bass: Fender Jazz Bass → UA Apollo → Logic Pro X
- Synths: Sequential Prophet 6, Arturia Pigments
- Drums: Superior Drummer 3 (custom kit)

## Mix Notes
- Heavy compression on bass to maintain consistent groove
- Reverb send on lead synth automated throughout
- EQ: Slight 3kHz boost on master bus for presence
- Reference tracks: Snarky Puppy "Lingus", Anomalie "Velours"

## Creative Process
Started with the bass line that came to me while walking at night. The synth pads were 
inspired by the way streetlights blur in the rain. The track evolved from a simple loop 
into a full arrangement over several late-night sessions.

## Collaboration
- Keys solo: Sarah Chen (recorded remotely, comped from 3 takes)
- Additional production: Marcus Williams

## Master Chain
1. FabFilter Pro-Q 3 (subtle surgical EQ)
2. Waves SSL Comp (2:1 ratio, slow attack)
3. Ozone 11 (Vintage Tape, subtle limiting)
4. LUFS: -14 (streaming ready)

## TODO
- [ ] Create radio edit (3:30 version)
- [ ] Send to playlist curators
- [ ] Film live performance video
