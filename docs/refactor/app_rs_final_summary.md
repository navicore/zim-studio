- `calculate_mono_levels()` - Mono RMS processing
- `update_playback_state()` - Playback and loop management
- `check_loop_boundaries()` - Loop boundary detection
- `apply_level_decay()` - Audio level decay

#### run_app() - 125 → 22 lines
Extracted into 7 focused functions:
- `handle_key_event()` - Main event dispatcher
- `handle_save_dialog_keys()` - Save dialog navigation
- `handle_browser_keys()` - File browser navigation
- `handle_player_keys()` - Player control handling
- `execute_save()` - Save operation execution
- `load_selected_file()` - File loading from browser
- `seek_audio()` - Audio seeking helper

#### save_wav_selection() - 62 → 27 lines
Extracted into 4 focused methods:
- `calculate_sample_range()` - Sample range calculation
- `copy_wav_samples()` - WAV sample copying dispatcher
- `copy_samples<T>()` - Generic sample copying
- Helper methods for type-safe operations

#### save_flac_to_wav_selection() - 55 → 36 lines
Extracted into 2 focused methods:
- `convert_flac_samples()` - FLAC sample conversion
- `convert_sample_to_16bit()` - Bit depth conversion

### 2. Test Coverage Improvements

**Before**: 0 tests
**After**: 18 comprehensive tests

#### Test Categories:
1. **State Management** (7 tests)
   - Initial state validation
   - Mark in/out operations
   - Selection management
   - Loop state transitions

2. **Playback Control** (3 tests)
   - Toggle playback
   - Position tracking
   - Loop boundary detection

3. **File Operations** (2 tests)
   - Save dialog creation
   - Selection handling

4. **Audio Processing** (6 tests)
   - Sample conversion
   - Level decay
   - Loop boundaries
   - Bit depth conversion

### 3. Code Quality Improvements

#### Readability
- Each method now has a single, clear responsibility
- Method names clearly indicate their purpose
- Complex logic is broken into understandable chunks

#### Maintainability
- Easier to modify individual features
- Reduced coupling between components
- Clear separation of concerns

#### Testability
- Smaller methods are easier to test
- Helper methods can be tested in isolation
- Better test coverage ensures reliability

## Metrics

### Line Count Reduction
- Largest method reduced from 125 to 22 lines
- Average method size: ~15 lines (down from ~40)
- Total extracted methods: 20

### Complexity Reduction
- Cyclomatic complexity significantly reduced
- Nesting depth decreased
- Each method focuses on one task

### Test Coverage
- 18 unit tests covering all public APIs
- Additional tests for critical helper methods
- All tests passing

## Remaining Opportunities

1. **Error Handling**
   - Create custom `PlayerError` type
   - Replace `Box<dyn Error>` with specific errors
   - Add error recovery strategies

2. **Type Safety**
   - Create newtype wrappers for positions/durations
   - Use const generics for bit depths
   - Add phantom types for state transitions

3. **Performance**
   - Benchmark audio processing paths
   - Optimize sample copying with SIMD
   - Add zero-copy optimizations where possible

## Conclusion

The refactoring of `app.rs` demonstrates significant improvements in:
- Code organization and readability
- Test coverage and reliability
- Maintainability and extensibility

The file is now well-structured, thoroughly tested, and ready for future enhancements.
