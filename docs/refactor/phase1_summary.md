# Phase 1 Summary: app.rs Refactoring

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Interface Analysis
- Documented all public methods and their responsibilities
- Identified 5 methods exceeding 50 lines
- Created comprehensive analysis document

### 2. Test Coverage
- Added 12 unit tests covering the public API
- Tests cover:
  - Initial state validation
  - Mark in/out functionality
  - Selection duration calculation
  - Loop toggling
  - Save dialog creation
  - Playback control

### 3. Refactoring Completed

#### update_waveform() Method (106 â†’ 4 lines)
Extracted into focused methods:
- `process_audio_samples()` - Sample reception and buffering
- `calculate_audio_levels()` - Audio level calculation dispatcher
- `calculate_stereo_levels()` - Stereo RMS calculation
- `calculate_mono_levels()` - Mono RMS calculation
- `update_playback_state()` - Playback position and loop management
- `check_loop_boundaries()` - Loop boundary detection
- `apply_level_decay()` - Level decay application

## Results
- Reduced largest method from 106 to 4 lines
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- All tests passing
- No functionality changes

## Remaining Work for app.rs

### Methods Still Needing Refactoring:
1. `run_app()` - 125 lines (event handling)
2. `save_wav_selection()` - 62 lines (WAV saving)
3. `save_flac_to_wav_selection()` - 55 lines (FLAC conversion)
4. `run_with_file()` - 51 lines (initialization)

### Additional Improvements Needed:
1. Error handling - Create custom error types
2. More comprehensive tests for private methods
3. Integration tests for full workflows
4. Performance benchmarks for audio processing

## Next Steps
Continue with remaining large methods or move to Phase 2 (audio.rs)?
