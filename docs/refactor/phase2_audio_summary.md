# Phase 2: audio.rs Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully analyzed and added test coverage to `player/audio.rs` (545 lines).

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Unit Tests
Created 8 unit tests covering the public API:
- `test_new_audio_engine()` - Tests successful engine creation
- `test_audio_engine_initial_state()` - Tests initial volume and progress
- `test_load_nonexistent_file()` - Tests handling of missing files
- `test_load_unsupported_format()` - Tests rejection of unsupported formats
- `test_play_pause_commands()` - Tests play/pause don't panic
- `test_volume_control()` - Tests volume settings
- `test_seek_without_file()` - Tests seeking behavior without loaded file
- `test_progress_without_file()` - Tests progress reporting without file

### 2. Test Challenges Resolved
- Adapted tests to work with rodio's Sink behavior (no initial paused state)
- Handled platform-specific volume clamping behavior
- Focused on testing public API without requiring actual audio files

### 3. Code Quality
- Fixed all test syntax errors
- Ensured formatting compliance
- All tests pass in CI

## Metrics
- Test count increased from 18 to 26 (8 new tests)
- No refactoring of production code was needed (code was already well-structured)
- All clippy warnings remain resolved
- CI pipeline remains green

## Next Steps
Phase 3 will focus on analyzing and testing `player/browser.rs` (478 lines).
